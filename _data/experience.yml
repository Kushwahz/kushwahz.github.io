   > I was assigned a project to automate the quality review process of dell.com webpages. In the organization, developer spends x amount of time on updating a page, while a quality reviewer spends x+1 amount of time to perform the quality check on the same page. I built a desktop application **<a href="https://github.com/Kushwahz/AEM-Crawler" style="color:#FFFFFF;"><mark>AEM crawler</mark></a>** which is an endeavour to reduce the time spent on peer reviewing the pages. Using the developed tool, the whole process was automated with almost all quality checklist points covered and then hundreds of hours of work is reduced to only few minutes.
